{"/collaborative-communities":{"title":"CS&S Services: Creating Collaborative Communities","view":"default","text":"## Services\n\n* [Community Calls](/community-call)\n* Project facilitation\n* Open source best practices workshops\n\n### Our Process\n\nProjects are slowed or made complex, despite the best efforts of team leaders, by communication issues and mismatched expectations. Team members find themselves bogged down, as more channels for communication make it harder to find information and get work done. Groups often reach for new software tools — like GitHub, Trello, and Slack — to improve workflows. But these are only tools. Without first creating alignment on goals and collaboration standards, collaboration tools are an additional burden. Effective communication and management processes are needed to take advantage of these tools in collaborative work. However, as each leader and team have unique needs and goals, there’s no single best practice that will work for all.\n\nWe facilitate communities to launch and sustain projects successfully. Code for Science & Society Executive Directors, Danielle and Joe, have introduced researchers around the world to open source approaches to running projects, managed development of a data collection platform used in over 30 countries, and coordinated global open source projects with hundreds of collaborators. By drawing on our experience and industry best practices, we empower groups to reach consensus on goals, standards, and processes to accelerate complex collaborative projects.\n\nHere’s what participants are saying about our recent in-person workshop with Chan Zuckerberg Science Human Cell Atlas group:\n\n> “Danielle Robinson + Joe Hand were amazing! I wished that everyone could go to this session to just talk about within-lab communication and project management.”\n\n> “[Thanks] to inspiration from @joeahand and @daniellecrobins (+ other attendees) at the … GitHub session @cziscience Collaborative Computational Tools meeting .. I finally up'd my GitHub game .. guidelines, branches, PRs, squash-and-merges for a course we are teaching ..” - Mark Robinson via Twitter\n\nRead more about the CZI event [on our blog](https://blog.datproject.org/2018/05/22/collaboration-czi/) and reach out to Joe and Danielle at hi@codeforscience.org to learn more.","name":"collaborative-communities","path":"/content/collaborative-communities","url":"/collaborative-communities","files":{},"pages":{}},"/community-call":{"title":"CS&S Community Call","view":"default","text":"**Join us for the CS&S Community Call every quarter!**\n\nMissed the last one?

However, running a sustainable open source project is about more than good code. Projects need support beyond software development throughout their lifetimes. Across industries, people are working to reimagine systems that allow ideas and data to flow freely, but these groups work in isolation. There is a clear need for services and supportive community spaces to set conditions for success and develop leaders in open source projects across domains.\n\nConnect with us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeforsociety), email us at hi@codeforscience.org, or join [our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dj7pnj).\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"w-50-l fl\">\nOur team has experience in leading, mentoring, and fiscally sponsoring projects in the public interest.
