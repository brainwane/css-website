about-text:

<div class="w-50-l fl pr5-l">
Open source software is a critical component of many public interest technologies. However, running a sustainable open source project is about more than good code. Projects need support beyond software development throughout their lifetimes. Across industries, people are working to reimagine systems that allow ideas and data to flow freely, but these groups work in isolation. There is a clear need for services and supportive community spaces to set conditions for success and develop leaders in open source projects across domains.

cta:

Most websites end their pages with some call to action or other fancy things to look at. It makes sense! You get to the bottom of the page and think, ok what next? Well, you made it. Chances are you skipped some of the stuff, but that is okay, we don't blame you. It is a long page! So what is next?

Our community is all about collaboration, and collaboration requires relationships and trust.

* **Learn more** Take 30min to an hour to watch one of [our community calls](/community-call). This is the fastest way to *feel* what our community is about.
* **Reach out** something something
* **Something fun**
